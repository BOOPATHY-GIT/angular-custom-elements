# Web Components with Angular 6 Elements - Build as a single bundle

In this example, I have created two custom elements, my-alert and my-button which are built as single bundle which is used in plain html file (non angular). 

This project is built using default Angular CLI setup

Commands:

* `npm run build && npm run package` to create a build of a sample component
* `npm run serve` to run a http-server with example usage (click the button, watch the devtools console)

I have created this example by referring below article and youtube video. Thanks to Tomek Su≈Çkowski and Academind Youtube channel!
